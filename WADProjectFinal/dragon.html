        Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared over forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth.

Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption.<br />

<br />An international publishing sensation, Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo combines murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into one satisfyingly complex and entertainingly atmospheric novel.

  I wish I could reread this from its original language. But I have to thank the translators who had done marvelous job for bringing out this unforgettable, one of my all time favorite series!<br />

I remember the first time I dive into this trilogy ( I don’t count the other released books as part of this breathtaking installment, in my opinion the series also died with its brilliant author). I was working on a script and I couldn’t sleep at night so I decided to read a few pages and go to bed. As you may guess I couldn’t go to bed for three days and called sick to read more!<br />

This is definitely dark, extremely bleak, twisty, WTF I just read kind of earth shattering story with graphic violence, sex. So it’s not every reader’s cup of tea! But when you get into it, you cannot stop reading. It’s gripping, fast, outstandingly riveting! You are literally drawn into the books and you never want them end.<br />
Lisbeth Salander might be one of the most complex, anti heroine we truly connect. Mikael Blomkvist: ambitious, idealist publisher of Millennium Magazine reminds us of the author of the book.<br />

You may also check out Swedish movie adaptations: Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, Michael Nyqvist ( RIP) are brilliant! ( They are even better than Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara)<br />

I absolutely recommend you to read all three books at one time. Don’t worry about the long pages or cancelling your entire plans. It’s the best thrilling ride you may get! I’m getting my second round with them after 14 years later. I’m still having amazing time! Best way to enjoy your weekend! Cheers!<br />

  Now that's what I'm talking about! I've never seen the genre political thriller get mentioned on Goodreads, but here is a prime candidate for this moniker.<br />

The translation seems elaborate, genuine, and faithful enough. The places or settings in the book are descriptive. The scenes are well lit.<br />

As for the plot, it's quite intricate. Read it and find out! The characterization is not world class, but the author gives the impression that he could write purple prose, if he wanted to.<br />

There is blackmail present in the book, and also deciphering of names, there are misdirections galore. Stieg Larsson packed so much in this book, you got to admire his work ethic. Five well earned stars.<br />
