    This was my first Agatha Christie novel and it definitely did not disappoint! I was not expecting that ending, which is obviously a good thing in a murder mystery story, but I am proud of myself for picking up on some other clues. I am so impressed by how she was able to weave this intricate of a story in only 200 pages and I can't wait to pick up another one of her novels in the future!

    I fear it is impossible to say too much about this book without spoilers. Because of this I will be brief so you can never go back and say, "I would have loved this book, but that Matthew guy from Goodreads ruined it for me!" So, here is my quick but hopefully useful review.<br />

  This is a classic mystery. You like mysteries? You have to have to read this!<br />

  Characters are great! So much fun meeting and learning about them all.<br />

  Current mysteries have nothing on Christie. This is very intricate and very fun to watch the clues be put together and the solution come into focus. But, now I am getting too close to spoilers.<br />

  Read it! It's good!

  This was my first, but definitely not my last, Agatha Christie book, and I truly loved it!<br />
It was a wonderful mystery that kept me guessing the whole way through.<br />
I really liked the structure of the novel. Each character getting their own chapter was a genius idea, it really helped me to get to know them. All of them seemed realistic and well developed, which was surprising, considering the amount of people and the rather short length of the book.<br />
The writing style was very atmospheric and enjoyable to read. It matched the genre perfectly.<br />
