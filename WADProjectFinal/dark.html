        Has a killer lain dormant for years only to strike again on New Year’s Eve? LAPD Detective Renée Ballard and Harry Bosch team up to find justice for an innocent victim in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly<br />

There's chaos in Hollywood on New Year's Eve. Working her graveyard shift, LAPD Detective Renée Ballard seeks shelter at the end of the countdown to wait out the traditional rain of lead as hundreds of revelers shoot their guns into the air. As reports start to roll in of shattered windshields and other damage, Ballard is called to a scene where a hardworking auto shop owner has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party.<br />

It doesn't take long for Ballard to determine that the deadly bullet could not have fallen from the sky. Ballard’s investigation leads her to look into another unsolved murder—a case at one time worked by Detective Harry Bosch.<br />

Ballard and Bosch team up once again to find out where the old and new cases intersect. All the while they must look over their shoulders. The killer who has stayed undetected for so long knows they are coming after him<br />

    Dark Hours is quite possibly the best book Connelly has penned in recent years and yet I was uncomfortable reading it. He cut too close to the bone on this one.<br />
  Dark hours referrers to the dark hours of graveyard shift, aka The Late Show a title from another Ballard novel. Connelly doesn’t pull any punches and describes the aftermath of societies the current upheaval; the defund the police campaign, and Covid. Usually I don’t finish a book if there are political messages or even undertones. I read to be entertained, to escape the world I live in, not to rehash it. But in this case—it’s Connelly for crying out loud. I read the whole thing.<br />
  In the story there are two crimes being investigated but they take a backseat to the dark tone of the book. Both crimes are particularly heinous and double-down on that same noir mood. Connelly had to have done it on purpose and by my estimation it was masterfully done. Ballard is more cynical and callouses than before with little patience for fellow employees, no sympathy for what they are going through only judgement. Ballard’s dog is even killed off. Yikes.<br />
  The absolute brilliant part of this book is the last two pages. Connelly hits us again and again with darkness then right at the end at the bleakest point he shows us a little light. Great read but not for the faint of heart. It will make you want to curl up on your couch with a half-gallon of cookies and cream ice cream.<br />

    This is the first mystery I’ve read that tackles COVID, Black Lives Matter, Defund the Police protests and the January 2021 Insurrection head on. I really appreciated that Connelly didn’t try to avoid the current times, like I see so many series doing. It’s NYE going into 2021 and the vaccine is around the corner. Renee Ballard has already had COVID. A majority of the police force is demoralized, working the bare minimum, because why bother?<br />
  She’s been partnered with Lisa Moore, of the Hollywood sex crimes unit to try and track down two tag-team serial rapists. But she also catches another case, a homicide that occurs at a NYE party. A homicide that has links to a murder Harry Bosch investigated years ago, before he retired. Of course, her LT wants her to turn over the murder to the Homicide dept. But she keeps delaying, while she and Harry begin an off the books investigation.<br />
  Connelly perfectly captures the mood of the police. It seems like Ballard is the only one that even cares anymore. As the story goes on, she walks a fine line between catching the criminals and the ire of the department.<br />
  I really enjoyed Ballard in the first three books, but she truly won my heart by adopting a rescue dog. This is truly Ballard’s story, not Harry’s. There’s a cliffhanger at the end and I’ll be curious to see how the next in the series starts off.<br />
  Once again, Connelly has put together a fabulous story. It moves quickly with a great sense of underlying suspense. I did see how the rape story was going to play out, but that didn’t dampen my enjoyment. I can only hope some studio is smart enough to tag this series for a tv mini-series.<br />
  My thanks to Netgalley and Little, Brown for an advance copy of this book.<br />

  This is the 23rd book in the Harry Bosch series by author Michael Connelly but is the character Renee Ballard features just as prominently. Michael Connelly is probably my favourite author so I was eager to read this and not surprisingly read it in one sitting. All the usual ingredients are there, great characters, interesting plot and expertly written.<br />

  LAPD Detective Renée Ballard and ex detective Harry Bosch team up to try and solve two cases where investigation appear to have hit a brick wall. In Hollywood on New Year’s Eve Ballard is called to a crime scene where an auto shop owner has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party.<br />
  Ballard’s investigation leads her to look into another unsolved murder that was previously worked by Detective Harry Bosch. Together Ballard and Bosch try to solve the shooting and search for a two rapists who have been called ‘the Midnight Men’ and team up to terrorise the public committing awful crimes.<br />

  400 pages went so quick as I raced through this novel, fast paced full of action and I loved every minute of it, I just wished there were another 400 pages. <br />
